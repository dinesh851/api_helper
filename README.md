API Helper and WebSocket Connection README
Introduction
This repository contains a Python-based API helper and WebSocket connection implementation. The purpose of this project is to facilitate the communication between a broker and a server, allowing the seamless transfer of data in real-time.

Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/api-websocket-helper.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd api-websocket-helper
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Follow the instructions below to use the API helper and WebSocket connection in your application.

API Helper
The API helper facilitates interactions with the broker's API. To use the API helper, follow these steps:

Import the api_helper module:

python
Copy code
from api_helper import APIHelper
Instantiate the APIHelper class with your API credentials:

python
Copy code
api = APIHelper(api_key='your_api_key', secret_key='your_secret_key')
Utilize the available methods within the APIHelper class to interact with the broker's API.

WebSocket Connection
The WebSocket connection allows real-time data streaming from the broker's server to your application. To use the WebSocket connection, follow these steps:

Import the websocket_connection module:

python
Copy code
from websocket_connection import WebSocketConnection
Instantiate the WebSocketConnection class with the required parameters:

python
Copy code
ws = WebSocketConnection(url='wss://your_websocket_url', on_message_callback=handle_message)
Define the handle_message function to process incoming WebSocket messages.

Start the WebSocket connection:

python
Copy code
ws.start()
Server to Get Data from Broker
To create a server that retrieves data from the broker and sends it to the client, follow these steps:

Import the required modules:

python
Copy code
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from api_helper import APIHelper
Define the DataHandler class to handle HTTP requests and retrieve data from the broker using the APIHelper class.

Implement the server logic within the DataHandler class.

Start the server:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    server_address = ('', 8000)  # Replace 8000 with your desired port
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, DataHandler)
    httpd.serve_forever()
