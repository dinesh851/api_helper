<h1>API Helper and WebSocket Connection README</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This repository contains a Python-based API helper and WebSocket connection implementation. The purpose of this project is to facilitate the communication between a broker and a server, allowing the seamless transfer of data in real-time.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dinesh851/api_helper.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the project directory:
    <pre><code>cd api_helper</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies:
    <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open file.py to log in: <code>python file.py</code></li>
  <li>Run socket-threads.py to get data from the server: <code>python socket-threads.py</code></li>
  <li>Run the file server to create a Python server and send out the data: <code>python file_server.py</code></li>
</ol>
file.py:

This script is responsible for handling the login process. It likely contains functionality to authenticate with the broker's API using a username and password or an API key. Running this script initiates the authentication process and allows the user to access the broker's data.
socket-threads.py:

This script sets up a WebSocket connection to the broker's server. It utilizes Python's threading capabilities to continuously listen for data from the server. As data is received, it likely processes and stores it for further use.
file_server.py:

This script creates a simple HTTP server in Python. It serves as a bridge between the data obtained from the broker and any client applications that need to access this data. It likely uses Python's built-in HTTP server capabilities to serve the data to clients.
To use these scripts, follow the instructions below:

Run the file.py script to initiate the login process with the broker. This might involve providing necessary credentials or API keys to authenticate the connection.

After successful authentication, run the socket-threads.py script to establish a WebSocket connection with the broker's server. This will allow the script to continuously receive real-time data from the broker.

Finally, execute the file_server.py script to start the Python server. This server will serve the data received from the broker to any clients that request it, providing a simple way to access the data obtained from the broker's server.

Make sure to follow any additional instructions or configurations provided within each script to ensure a successful connection and data transfer between the broker and the server.
